 And a .so, or .pyd or... will be created for you. It will build a version that matches the python that you run the command with. Taking apart the command line:

    python -- the version of python you want to build for
    setup.py -- the name of your setup script (it can be called anything, but setup.py is the tradition)
    build_ext -- telling distutils to build extensions
    --inplace -- this tells distutils to put the extension lib in the current dir. Otherwise, it will put it inside a build hierarchy, and you'd have to move it to use it. 

The distutils have many other features, consult the python distutils docs for details.
