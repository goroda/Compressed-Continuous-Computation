If a multidimensional function is discretized onto a regular grid, it becomes a tensor. One can then use a tensor-train decomposition to decompose this function.

This can also be done with a function-train decomposition by assuming a piecewise-constant reconstruction of the tensor.

In this directory I show a simple example of using cross-approximation in piecewise-constant format.
