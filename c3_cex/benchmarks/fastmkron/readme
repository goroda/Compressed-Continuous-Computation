This benchmark tests how the fast mat-kron algorithm performs compared to the direct method. Specifically
we are computing A(kron(B,C)) where

A is a matrix 
B,C are matrix-valued functions

the direct method first computes kron(B,C) then it premultiplies this matrix-valued function by A.
The fast method takes a different approach (see associated documentation and papers for this approach).


The tests are performed on 50 randomly sampled qmarrays for each test point

The data output files have columns
x0 = independent axis
x1 = time for the direct kron first and then matrix-mvf multiplication
x2 = time for the fast version

Also, for each randomly sampled matrix the final results are asserted to be equivalent
